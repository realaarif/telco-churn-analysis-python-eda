# Telco Customer Churn Analysis – Python EDA

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project presents a **comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of telecommunications customer churn using Python.  
The main objective is to uncover **key drivers of customer attrition** and provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve retention strategies.  

Through advanced data visualization and statistical analysis, raw customer data has been transformed into **actionable business intelligence** for telecom companies.

## 📊 Dataset and Analysis  

- **Platform**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Dataset**: Telecommunications Customer Data  
- **Total Records**: 7,043 customers  
- **Features**: 21 attributes (demographics, services, billing, churn status)  
- **Data Quality**: Complete dataset (no missing values or duplicates)  
- **Target Variable**: Customer Churn (Yes/No) – **26.5% churn rate**  

#### 🔑 Key Data Categories  
- **Demographics**: Gender, Senior Citizen, Partner, Dependents  
- **Service Usage**: Tenure, Phone Service, Internet Type, Multiple Lines  
- **Add-on Services**: Online Security, Backup, Device Protection, Tech Support, Streaming

## 🔍 Key Insights  

### Critical Churn Patterns  
- **High-Risk Period**: 50%+ churn occurs within the first 3 months of service  
- **Contract Influence**: Month-to-month customers are 40% more likely to churn than annual contract holders  
- **Service Issues**: Fiber optic users show **30% higher churn rates** → service quality concerns  
- **Add-on Value**: Customers without security/support services are **30% more likely to leave**  
- **Payment Friction**: Electronic check users churn significantly more often  

### Financial & Operational Impact  
- **Revenue Loss**: 26.5% churn = substantial financial hit  
- **Customer Lifetime Value**: Long-tenure customers (>12 months) show strong loyalty and higher total charges  
- **Price Sensitivity**: Higher monthly charges increase churn probability  
- **Demographics**: Senior citizens & dependents show distinct churn patterns
